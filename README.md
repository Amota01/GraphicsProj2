# GraphicsProj2

Hi!

You've stumbled on my path to learning graphics programming. I've always had a fascination for visual aesthetics and now I decided to understand GPU programming and how it renders data into basic blanket single-color frames to frames nearly resembling a picture from a photobook.

I am learning to use the DirectX library through C++, helping me understand the low-level aspects of graphics and incorporate robust C++ programming practices to make my programs as safe and portable as possible.

You'll observe my progression as I learn the various aspects of this art and my attempts at experimenting with it, trying my best to find my own voice in graphics. This discipline is the closest programming comes to resembling art, and with any kind of art, I hope you too can be moved by the beauty that the art of graphics entails.
